# Fake News Detector

## Project Title & Description

**Fake News Detector** is a machine learning-based web application designed to classify news as either *Real* or *Fake*. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Naive Bayes classifier, it offers a simple, interactive interface for users to input news text and receive classification results instantly.

This project leverages Python, Streamlit, and NLP techniques to combat the spread of misinformation.

## Features

- ✅ Real-time prediction of fake or real news.
- 🧠 Pre-trained Naive Bayes model with NLP preprocessing.
- 📊 Displays model performance metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix).
- 💻 Streamlit web interface for user interaction.
- 🔍 Easily extensible with new datasets or models.

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to install and run the application locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Atullodhi/Fake-news-detector.git
   cd Fake-news-detector

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Download required NLTK data:
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')

5. Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py

Usage -
1. Open the web app in your browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).
2. Enter the news article text in the input area.
3. Click "Predict" to check whether the news is real or fake.
4. View classification results and optional model metrics.
